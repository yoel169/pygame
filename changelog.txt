2.6: * slow day today... got a HUD working that can be used across levels
     * Got the first level working with the new HUD, took forever
     * First three levels working.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.62:* got enemy shooting mechanics
     * got 4 levels now
     * fixed where buffs were spawning too high
     * fixed a enemy spawn issue
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.65:* Restructured all of the levels for more organization and better control
     * Each part in the loop is well documented
     * Restructured buffs and enemies into their classes for easier calling
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.68 * All this restructuring led to a level maker... YUP! I FEEL LIKE GOD! Level maker can take in arguments and
       generate a whole level without having to write the whole code for it... Still need to add more features like
       multiple enemies at the same time but holy shit i did it! Object oriented up the ass!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7 * what's a level maker without a level maker script? Yup that's done. pretty good for now just don't input wrong values!
      Now I just have to implement into back in my level maker and make a level unpacker. Hope it goes well or I oop!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8 * 100% done with implementing my level maker idea! Everything from the script maker works. Im not sure how accurate
      the random is but I honestly its amazing what I've done.
    * Created tabs in documentation for proper placement.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 ** Welcome to 3.0 baby! A lot has changed since 1.0 version. We're now int he automation era.
    * Changes level style. So game consists of stages, and each stage has multiple parts or levels. So stages are
      packs of parts (levels). The first 3 stages are implemented and you can play them right now. The player info like
      health, damage, and bullet speeds transfer over between each part and reset when a stage is done. What about waves?
      Waves will still be implemented on harder stages so parts can still have waves.
    * Player now starts with full health. You lose if you run out of health. If you run out of lives, you reset the stage
      back to part 1. Lives do not carry over between stages like in most games.
    * Renamed some files like LevelPackMaker to Game, ScriptMaker to GameMaker, and LevelpackUnpacker to GamePackUnpacker
      because it just makes more sense. Also outdated folder contains... well outdated code for referencing my hard
      work ;)
    * Constants class saves screen size and applies it to classes that need it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 * Player can now save and load their progress. It saves their stats, stage and part, as well as settings.
    * Player gets passed between parts instead of passing the player values. Player gets reset to defaults after a stage.
    * Moved HUD labels around and added add money, part and time info.
    * Created a game config json file that saves the users screen preference. Changing the screen at settings will update
     it.
    * Moved main menu selections to add a player info panel. Changed some colors yay finally. Updated attributes file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 * Save/Load menus and player panel working. It's beautiful uwu. MOVING ON!
    * Added a launch menu for first time users to pick or create a profile. It will save into the config json file and
      next time they load the game it will automatically load that profile. If the game is not working check the config
      file to see if the player name exists as save if not just make it empty "".
    * XP system working.
