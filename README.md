# World Flying Shooter
 Just a student having some fun with python.

Description: flying jet fighting different enemies.

Download files and assests and run 'Driver.py' (python Driver.py).
Dependecies: python, pygame, pygame_gui

Game: default arrows to move, default auto shoot, can be changed in main menu under settings. Game currently consists of 4 levels.     Each level gets harder. On top, it will tell you how many points needed for next wave or level. On wave 4, a new enemy can now shoot you, careful! After you beat it, it will kick you to the main menu. 

Changes can be found in the changelog.txt and plans for next updates in roadwork.txt. You can also find more information about the enemies, levels, and future content in the documentation file.

Known bug: game does not rescale to your screen size and is currently set to run in a 1920 * 1080 screen at full screen by default. This can be changed in the settings option and select windowed, then resize the window. Currently, the window resizes but not what's inside so I have to fix that too.
